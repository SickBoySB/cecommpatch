  Quick summary of how this works.
  MODULES!
  I hope you like reading a wall of text because modules are so varied that setting them up has
  become a virtual spiderweb of code. Theoretically speaking there's enough
  here to mod basically anything into the game as very little of this hits C++, but
  god damn I hope you have some patience.
  
  Anyway here's a quick and hopefully readable summary of all the fields
  
  <module>
     name = internal name. should have corresponding entry in modules.edb
     display_name = what the player sees
     icon_skin = xml file pointing to icons
     icon = icon name in icon_skin
     model = upm model for this module
     width = maya x-axis tiles across. defines footprint when placing (roughly 8 maya units is one tile, but that's moot here - just input the number in tiles.)
     height = above but z-axis tiles across
     internal = 1 if it is placed inside a building, otherwise just leave this field out
     internal_wall = 1 if it is a module that can only be placed on an interior wall, otherwise leave this field out
     cut_wall = 1 if it is a window, otherwise 0
     passable = 1 if characters can walk through this module's tile (rugs/windows etc) otherwise 0
     short_description = gameplay description which shows up in gold
     description = fluff description which shows up in grey
     quality = negative or positive number of what effect module has on building quality. modules.edb needs this info as well
     upkeep_type = DEPRECIATED
     upkeep_quantity = DEPRECIATED
     decor = 1 if decor item otherwise 0
     script = specifies if this module has an associated .go file to run when it is created
     order_string = determines the order this module shows up in the module listing. see more detailed explanation below
     social_class = I think this is a vestige of when we planned to give modules a social class and does nothing
     <filter name = /> determines if it shows up in the "all decor" button set or not. we used to have a furniture filter too but that is depreciated
     <module_requirement> = this is where a module's costs to build are set
        tag= tag that the box for this module uses. if you want it to be built raw you can put item tags in here instead
        art= icon that shows up for this in the module menu tooltip. CAN ONLY BE FROM COMMODITYICONS
        amount = how many of the thing you need to build it
     <module_requirement/>
     <animation> = any anims associated with this module, one for each
        name = internal name to be referenced in job_times to trigger this anim
        file = name of upa file for the animation. must be a rigid body animation, modules don't currently support joints
     <animation/>
     <access_point x="0" y="0"/> = if a module uses the frontaccessmodule script then this is where it will be accessed. You can have multiple. If you don't give a front access module at least one of these it can't be constructed.
     
     <module_jobs_for> This is where we all the recipes for modules in workshops are set up. They also need corresponding entries in workshop_jobs.xml and job_times.xml. If you're adding a new item you'll also want entries in commodity.edb and commodity.xml.
        name = name of building wherein these recipes will be visible
        <module_job> this designates a single recipe
             name = internal name which must be the same as this job's entry in job_times and workshop_jobs
             display_name = name of job in tooltip? I think
             icon_skin = xml file pointing to relevant icon set
             icon = icon name from above file
             standing_order_display_name = technically depreciated but I fill it in to be safe
             product_name = recipe title the player actually sees in the recipe list
             default_state = "hidden" if you want this recipe to be invisible until either <greyed> or <visible> requirements below are met. Otherwise leave this line out.
             <greyed or visible> = use this to determine the conditions under which this recipe is shown. <greyed> makes something show up as a grey icon if
               it was default_state = "hidden" but otherwise has no effect. <visible> is more less "enabled" and will light up the button from its default state of grey in default-visible recipes.
               Note that being greyed out doesn't prevent the player from clicking on or building a recipe, it is informative only
                  <require_session_bool = is used to require gamestate variables flipped on or off
                       name = sessionbool name (usually a tech or biome)
                       value = 1 for require on, 0 for require off.
                       failure_reason = failure reason displayed when this bool is not flipped properly. Note that failure reasons don't display on hidden recipes
                  />
                  <require_commodity_geq> used to require a specific commodity using its internal name
                       is_cost = this number corresponds to the <cost> tags below. 1 is the first one in order. 2 is the 2nd. etc.
                  <require_gameobject> used to require anything from a set of gameobjects using a tag
             <cost = is used to send cost icons to tooltip
                  name= COMMODITYICONS.XML ONLY icon name for required commodity
                  display_name = name the player sees
                  amount = count of how many you need. this is all visual only, if you fuck up here it won't affect gameplay merely confuse people
             />
             <out = sends the product itself to the job when excecuted + assembles tooltip
                  product = INTERNAL COMMODITY NAME of product to output. This is sent to the workshop_job when excecuted. This also is queried for the item's icon in its tooltip
                  amount = how many to output. I think this is tooltip only because we set output amounts in job_times.xml for some insane reason
             />
        </module_job>
     </module_jobs_for>
  </module>
  
  
BUILDINGS!
     Buildings are kind of restricted to 3 types (office, house, workshop) and as such are a lot simpler to setup.
     At the moment you can't hook up custom ui dialogs to them except via C++ (it's hardcoded)
     
<building>
     script = associated .go file for this building. "workshop" if it's a workshop, "house" if a house, offices each have custom ones
     description = DEPRECIATED, building descriptions are in commands.xml now
     icon = orderIcons.xml only icon for this building
     social_class = pretty sure this is depreciated
     order_string = order in the module menu, see below. if you wanna reorder the actual building menu use commands.xml
     <buildingbase type = "freeform" /> = don't touch this
     <textures/> = all the textures for various bits of building, should be fairly self explanatory
     <addition/> = use this to make a non-decor module actually placeable in this building and to add it to the modules menu list for this building. required=1 does nothing so ignre it
     <construction_cost/> = set of figures for how much it costs to build a building when you're dragging it out.
     If you want to change building construction times that's set in the fsm for building stuff, go there 
     
</building/>


A brief note on sort ID: it's alphabetical (similar to windows) so 11 comes before 2.
For this reason we use a sort ID system of 6 numbers. the first two are overall category,
the second two are subcategory, and last two are individual ID.
